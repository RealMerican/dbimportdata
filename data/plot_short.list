PL: and then are locked in an isolation booth. The couple has 60 seconds to

PL: subsequent bonus round and thus having to leave the show. Only by winning
PL: three bonus rounds in a row did the couple win the $1 million grand prize.

MV: "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982)

PL: René Artois runs a small café in France during World War II. He always
PL: seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his
PL: waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German
PL: soldiers who frequent his café, and he's running a major underground
PL: operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself
PL: is what nearly lands René and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped
PL: either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans,
PL: but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often
PL: create problems that René must solve quickly.

BY: Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

PL: René Artois is the owner and manager of a café in German-occupied France of
PL: World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him
PL: irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith.
PL: René's café, frequented by both the German military and the French
PL: resistance, is the focal point for the show. René's a bit of a coward and
PL: is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the café are
PL: two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters
PL: include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil
PL: SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his
PL: small sidekick. René's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering
PL: and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with
PL: Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for
PL: servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British
PL: agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of "Zee Fronch
PL: Linguige," and from René's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.

BY: Rob Hartill

PL: In this spoof of World War II, René Artois runs a café in German-occupied
PL: France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the
PL: command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the
PL: command of Michelle Dubois ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only
PL: once"). René is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the
PL: world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots
PL: include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General
PL: Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called "The
PL: Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"--a painting that everybody would love
PL: to get their hands on to sell after the war. He has also two downed idiot
PL: British airmen who, as time goes by, are impossible to get rid of. The main
PL: opposition is the insane SS officer Otto Flick. René tries to complete the
PL: German and the Fench Resistance's plans, even though he's a coward and
PL: wonders if he's going to get out of the war alive.
