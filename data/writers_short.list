===============================================================================

Formats
-------
(TV)    = TV movie or made for cable movie
(V)     = made for video movie (this category does NOT include TV episodes
          repackaged for video or variety/comedy specials released on video)
(mini)  = mini-series

Legend
------
(song)        =  The writer is the author (composer?) of a song on
                 which the screenplay was based.
(story)       =  The writer contributed on the story for the
                 screenplay only or the writer is the author of a
                 story on which the movie was based.
(play)        =  The writer is the author of the play on which the
                 screenplay was based.
(novel)       =  The writer is the author of the novel on which the
                 screenplay was based.
(novel XXX)   =  The writer is the author of the novel on which the
                 screenplay was based, but the novel is not the same
                 title as the movie.
(book)        =  The writer is the author of the book on which the
                 screenplay was based.
(article)     =  The writer is the author of the article on which the
                 screenplay was based.
(operetta)    =  The writer is the author of the operetta on which the
                 screenplay was based.
(also XXX)    =  The writer was involved in some other aspect than just
                 writing the screenplay.  They may have authored the novel
                 the screenplay was based on, or developed the story, etc.

Entries are not accepted for "(characters)" or "(idea)".

Entries are also not accepted for TV series, largely because we are not
yet prepared to deal with episodes in a comprehensive way.

Awards data is no longer being accepted; it should now go to the separate
awards list.

The two most common reason for new entries being rejected are that 
they are for characters/ideas, or they are for TV series.  Because of the
volume of additions, there is no guarantee you will get E-mail if your
entry is rejected.

Screenwriting credits are tightly controlled; we have recently added
sequence numbers to represent the fine details in the listings.  These
are still being updated on older titles.  Specifically:

1.  "&" vs. "and" in screenwriting credits: in WGAw parlance, a
writing team with names linked by an ampersand ("&") is considered a
writing unit, and wrote their contribution to the screenplay in
collaboration.  Writers separated by "and" were not in direct
collaboration, and in all likelihood are writers of successive drafts
of the screenplay.  It is virtually certain that they never even met,
let alone talked about the script.

2.  First and second (and third, etc.) writing credit.  According to
WGAw guidelines, the first writing unit to appear in the credits is
the one which has had the most effect on the finished product, then
the next most important, etc.

The sequence number is three numbers, separated by commas.  When the first two
numbers are the same, the writers are connected with "&"; when the first
number is the same and the second number is different, the writers are
connected with "and".  The first number is used to separate different
attributes (story, segments, etc.)  For example, at this writing the credits
on Chairman of the Board (1997) read "Story by Turi Meyer & Al Septien;
screenplay by Turi Meyer & Al Septien and Alex Zamm".  This shows up in the
database as:

Meyer, Turi|Chairman of the Board (1997)|(story)|1,1,1
Septien, Al|Chairman of the Board (1997)|(story)|1,1,2
Meyer, Turi|Chairman of the Board (1997)||2,1,1
Septien, Al|Chairman of the Board (1997)||2,1,2
Zamm, Alex|Chairman of the Board (1997)||2,2,1

Note that the original source or story always comes first, regardless of
on-screen credit order.  If names have no punctuation between them, assume
they are joined by "&".
